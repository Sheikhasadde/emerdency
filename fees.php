            <h2>Appointment with a Dentist (£50)</h2>
            <p>The aim of this appointment is to get you out of pain, however, at this stage definitive treatment is not provided. Following the Emerdency appointment, should definitive treatment be required you may need to arrange a further appointment with a dentist in order for this to be carried out. If definitive treatment is indeed required, this can be discussed with the Emerdency dentist or you can choose to have this treatment done elsewhere at your own discretion. <br/>
                An initial fee of £15 will be charged online when the appointment is booked. A further £35 will then be charged at the dental practice.</p>
