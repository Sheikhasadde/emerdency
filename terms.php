This Terms of Service regulate all of our Services provided to Clients, which are offered with previous acceptance by you without modification.

            <h3>3.2 Use of Services</h3>
            <p>Through the Website, Emerdency concedes the Client a personal right, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, revocable and limited of access and use of the Services strictly with the purposes of exploring the Services and searching through the Providers for the scheduling of an appointment, acting Emerdency as an intermediate, in any case;<p>

            <h3>3.3 Services of intermediation and payment management for medical services.</h3>
            <p>Emerdency shall provide Services which only allow the Clients to find Providers for the pathologies and symptoms they may suffer, acting as an intermediate between Clients and Providers. In the contracts realised through the Website, Emerdency acts as a commissioner with the only purpose of collecting payments done in favour of the Providers. The Client is only responsible for the obligations that he/she may assume as part of scheduling an appointment with a Provider. Emerdency is not a dental professional that gives medical advice, or responsible for the results of a consultation, treatment or advice that the Client has selected and appointed with a Provider.<p>
            <h3>3.4 Fees.</h3>
            <p>An initial fee of £15 will be charged online when the appointment is booked. A further £35 will then be charged at the dental practice.</p>
            <p>In the event a telephone consultation is required, a single fee of £15 will be payable to Emerdency via the website prior to the appointment.</p>
            <p>The creation of accounts and the access to the Services are free. Emerdency will only charge the standard fee to the Clients when an appointment or a telephone call is scheduled with a Provider. Extra charges will apply in case of a tooth extraction and shall be paid according to Section 3.6 of these Terms & Conditions. All the descriptions of the fees are in Appendix “A” of these Terms & Conditions.</p>
            <h3>3.5 Services included in the Standard Fee.</h3>

                b.	X-rays and reports;<br/>

                j.	Re-implantation of an Avulsed permanent tooth; and<br/>
                k.	Easing of dentures; this doesn’t include anything that requires sending the denture away for repair to a dental laboratory.</p>
            <p>These services are only intended to cause dental relief. The Provider will have the discretion to refuse to lend any of the services (including teeth extractions) if the Client presents a complex or delicate medical history.</p>
            <p>In case of scheduling a phone call, it shall last a maximum of ten (10) minutes, and will not include the services explained in literals b), c), d), e), f), g), h), i), j), k) of this clause. The Client understands and recognises that the accuracy of a Provider’s criteria may be lower in comparison to an appointment, as there may be a lack of physical examination. The phone call shall be carried out by Emerdency from a withheld or private number at the appointed time, to the phone number indicated by the Client, Emerdency reserves the right to carry out the phone appointment ten (10) minutes earlier or later, at its sole discretion. At the time of the phone call, Emerdency will make three (3) attempts to call the client, if, the said calls are not answered, Emerdency may do a further fourth attempt, at any time on any day.</p>
            <p>The Services offered through the Website of Emerdency do not include permanent treatments. In the event the Client needs a permanent treatment, the said treatment shall be paid and negotiated directly between the Client and the Provider. Under no circumstances Emerdency will be associated to permanent treatments, and therefore has no responsibility in any way for those treatments.</p>
            <p>Surgical extractions are not included within the treatments provided via Emerdency appointment.</p>
            <p>Following the appointment, should the patient’s symptoms remain unresolved, a second appointment will be arranged for the patient with the dentist free of charge within the time period of a week (7 days). Beyond this, the patient will need to arrange another appointment as they should have seen a dentist for definitive treatment.</p>
            <p>It is the Client’s responsibility to have available a translator if he/she needs it, it is not the obligation of Emerdency or the Provider to have one available.</p>
            <h3>3.6 Fund and Refund Management.</h3>
            <p>Through the Services, Emerdency will receive, upfront from the Client, the payment for an appointment or phone call with a Provider and the remaining balance will be paid at the dental practice for an appointment. Nevertheless, Emerdency will not transfer the amount correspondent to the Provider until the Client informs through the Website his/her conformity as agreed. In case of any dispute between a Client and a Provider, both agree to try to resolve it amicably, Emerdency will not be forced to return the funds to the Client. In case the dispute between a Client and a Provider transcends to a possible lawsuit, Emerdency will be free of any responsibility/liability that the Provider may have for defective performance or breach in the contract, agreement or transaction with the Client.</p>
            <p>In no case, the Client will have to pay any extra amounts during an appointment or phone call, unless a tooth extraction is needed, where the Client shall pay directly to the provider the Extra fee specified in Appendix “A” of these Terms & Conditions. In the event a Client is forced to pay an unjustified extra amount, the Client shall keep a copy of the receipt and provide Emerdency with a copy of the same in order for Emerdency to consider the payments.</p>
            <p> In the event the Client may want to cancel an appointment, this shall be done via communicating through the online contact form, no later than twenty-four (24) hours before, the said appointment in order to obtain a full refund. If the Client does not respect this time lapse, there will be no right to a refund.</p>
            <p>If the Client arrives later than ten (10) minutes after the time for the scheduled appointment, the Client will lose its right to have the said appointment, and there will be no right to a refund. In order to avoid losing an appointment Emerdency recommends, to the Client, that he/she arrives ten (10) minutes prior to the appointment. In addition to this the Client shall bring with him/her a list of all the medications he/she is currently taking, if, the said list is not available to the Provider at the appointment, the Provider may refuse to proceed with the consultation with no right to refund.</p>
            <p>If the Client does not answer an appointed phone call for consultation after the first three (3) attempts specified on Clause 3, Section 3.5, there shall be no right for a refund.</p>
            <h3>3.7 Late attendance</h3>
            <p>The Providers are obligated to be punctual at Clients appointment. However, as it is proper of the dental profession to attend to unexpected emergencies that need immediate attention, the Provider will have the right to overrun or postpone an appointment with the Client if that kind of emergency arises, the Client will not have to pay any extra amount to re-schedule or for late attendance.</p>
