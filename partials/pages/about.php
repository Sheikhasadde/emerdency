				<h2>It all Started with a Vision for Improved Access to Emergency Dental Care</h2>
	            <p>As practicing dentists and the founders of Emerdency, we understand the challenges faced when trying to book an emergency dental appointment all too well. Often, you are left helpless and vulnerable to the wrath of dental pain.</p>
	            <p>Following years of seeing patients suffer through dental pain while in search of help at times of need, we as the founders of Emerdency have revolutionised and utilised modern technology to formulate a forward-thinking solution to serve the general public.</p>

	            <h2>Emergency dental appointments at your fingertip</h2>
	            <p>Emerdency has taken the country by storm.  It is reaching out to you in Greater Manchester, West Midlands, West Yorkshire, Merseyside and South Yorkshire. Whenever you face an urgent dental issue, you can turn to Emerdency; an online self-service booking system that you can use to book your emergency dental appointment with a local General Dental Council (GDC) registered dentist.

	            <p>No more repeating calls to multiple dental practices to check for appointment availability. No more uncertainty in pricing structures. Enjoy one seamless experience to take care of your immediate dental care needs during an emergency.

	            <h2>Emerdency is only a call away</h2>
	            <p>Emerdency also provides an all in one telephone advice line.
	            <p>Need reassurance, advice or a second opinion directly from a dentist?

	            <p>Emerdency has cut out the middleman. Book your phone consultation online and speak directly with a dentist you can count on.

	            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
	            <p>To provide quick, flexible, transparent and professional emergency dental care to the general public.

	            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
	            <p> To become a leading platform for the booking of emergency dental appointments throughout the UK.

	            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
	            <p>Emerdency has been founded and nurtured on four core principles:
	            <ul>
	                <li>To improve emergency dental access for the people of the UK</p>
	                <li>To utilise modern technology to make the lives of the general public more convenient</li>
	                <li>To offer patients more flexibility to schedule their dentist appointments effortlessly</il>
	                <li>To remove pricing uncertainty by standardising and setting a fixed price for the services.</li>
	            </ul>

	            <h2>The Emerdency Promise</h2>
	            <p>As Ogden Nash once said, </p>
	            <span class="quote"><em>“Some tortures are physical, and some are mental, but the one that is both is dental.”</em></span>
	            <p>No one understands this better than Emerdency.</p>
	            <p>Every dentist on the Emerdency platform is a reputable, highly-trusted professional. We verify every dentist's qualification and GDC registration before we grant them a place on our platform.</p>
	            <p>So, go ahead, book your emergency dental appointment today.</p>
