            <h2>It all Started with a Vision for Improved Access to Emergency Dental Care</h2>
            <p>As practicing dentists and the founders of Emerdency, we understand the challenges faced when trying to book an emergency dental appointment all too well. Often, you are left helpless and vulnerable to the wrath of dental pain.</p>
            <p>Following years of seeing patients suffer through dental pain while in search of help at times of need, we as the founders of Emerdency have revolutionised and utilised modern technology to formulate a forward-thinking solution to serve the general public.</p>

            <h2>Emergency dental appointments at your fingertip</h2>
            <p>Emerdency has taken the country by storm.  It is reaching out to you in Greater Manchester, West Midlands, West Yorkshire, Merseyside and South Yorkshire. Whenever you face an urgent dental issue, you can turn to Emerdency; an online self-service booking system that you can use to book your emergency dental appointment with a local General Dental Council (GDC) registered dentist.

            <p>No more repeating calls to multiple dental practices to check for appointment availability. No more uncertainty in pricing structures. Enjoy one seamless experience to take care of your immediate dental care needs during an emergency.

            <h2>Emerdency is only a call away</h2>
            <p>Emerdency also provides an all in one telephone advice line.
